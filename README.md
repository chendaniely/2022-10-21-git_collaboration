## Exercise 1

1. Create a new repository on github
	- with a README.md + LICENCE + .gitigore
2. `clone` the repository to your computer
	- usually somewhere in `~/git`
3. In the `README.md` file define `git clone` and `git init`
4. `git add` and `git commit` your changes
5. `git push` your changes back up to your github repository


- `git clone <URL>`: "downloads" the repository to current directory
	- `git init`: initializes the current directory as a git repository

- `git branch <NAME>`: creates a branch <NAME> where HEAD is
- `git branch -a`: list all the branches you have
- `git switch <NAME>`: moves HEAD / switches you to the branch <NAME>
	- `git checkout <NAME>`: "older" command to switch branches
